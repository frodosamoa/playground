This is my repository for all of the fun code that I have written in the past. Some are class problems I solved and some are projects that I worked on for personal enjoyment. Here is a list of what is here:

##1. Clock Solver

Have you ever wondered when the clock hands are at an 180 degree angle? How about at a 45 degree angle? This `.java` program will solve these pesky questions with ease.

##2. Changemaker

Everyone can agree that pocket change is pretty annoying. Ever want to know what the smallest amount of coins a certain amount of cents are? With the American coin denominations, greed works. Take as many of the largest denomination possible until you can't. Rinse and repeat with the next smallest coin until you have your change. But what about Alien worlds who have coin denominations listed as this: `1`, `3`, `8`, `13`, and`17` cent coins? This `.java` program will find the smallest amount of change necessary for any combination of denominations.
